> My core technical skills are: designing and implementing surveys, advanced analytics and impact evaluations, but I have also demonstrated effective leadership and resourcefulness in project management roles. As a life-long learner, I am passionate about exploring new data sources and analytical tools to tackle various public policy challenges. \hfill
