In this this R project I  created 4 versions of my CV

0. (A long academic style CV (Eng) + .bib)
1. **A long academic style CV (Eng)**
2. **A long academic style CV (ITA)**
3. **A long academic style CV (Eng) + Project list at the end**
4. Short "Data-Sciencey" resume + pic
   + (issue with LAtex --> must go to .....tex & compile PDF from there)


## Acknowledgement  
  1. & 2. taken from adapted from **svmiller** great blog post and [source code](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/).
This method requires only a single **.Rmd** and a formatted **.tex** file. This has been kindly 
Another evolution of it is in https://www.jungjulie.com/2020/01/12/update-your-cv-in-r-markdown/

 3. Need to got to tex file for PDF (error due to tibble::tribble that cannot turn links in LATEX anymore )
